This code served its purpose during my BSBA at TBS end-of-studies internship.
Collecting data from 100 pages of linkedin research automatically and exporting them to a .csv file.
Multiple linkedin **anti-scraping bypass mechanisms** were used.
This collection had no malicious intents, made no profits out of it, and the data was used for analysis and not shared nor sold.
No third party platforms or extensions were used.

**IMPORTANT** : 
- **You have to be signed in**- in chrome browser, if not possible then change the driver - **for this code to work.**
- IT would preferable if you used a throwaway account just in case you account gets flagged so you won't get banned from linkedin. However most searches would show as "Linkedin User", so it might be best to use a verified throwaway account or use the free Premium plan.
